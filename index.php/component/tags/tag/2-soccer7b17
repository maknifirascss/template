&lt;p&gt;Arsenal edged slightly closer to the Barclays Premier League’s two with a commanding victory over West Ham United on the weekend.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Arsene Wenger’s Gunners picked up their eighth league win in nine outings with a 3-0 home result over the Hammers thanks to goals from Olivier Giroud, Aaron Ramsey and Mathieu Flamini to move within a point of second-placed Manchester City and seven of league leaders Chelsea. Reigning premiers City were dealt a massive title blow when losing 1-0 to relegation battlers Burnley at Turf Moor which came via a stunning strike from George Boyd in the 61st minute.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jordan Henderson struck in the 68th minute at the Liberty Stadium as Brendan Rodgers’ men continued their march towards a Champions League spot.&lt;/p&gt;
