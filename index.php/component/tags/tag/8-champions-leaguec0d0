Reigning premiers City were dealt a massive title blow when losing 1-0 to relegation battlers Burnley at Turf Moor which came via a stunning strike from George Boyd in the 61st minute.</p>
<p>Jordan Henderson struck in the 68th minute at the Liberty Stadium as Brendan Rodgers’ men continued their march towards a Champions League spot.</p>
